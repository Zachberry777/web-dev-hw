#Questionaire
Alt Text is a alternative way of using the HTML document and we use it so the viewers the content of the of the website or image.
They have basics like what we are and what age and mainly basic Questionaire. The purpose the have is that they know what they are about to work with or even use for statistics or survey's.
The work cycle I went through is to always look at the assignment first and read it through, I then make the side folders for the assignment and organize it. After that I go through the weeks content. I go through each step as i go through the content so i have several pagees up. I did have some issues eith some of the HTML and how to do it. I did solve it by going back and when i was really stuck id do to the disscsion part and see how other people did it. It was very helpful. I did not post anything to the issue bored yet but it is getting harder and i will fimilurise my self soon with the issue board.
