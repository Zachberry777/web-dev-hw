 #Atari

##I went with Shadows+Into+Light, and Amatic+SC, because they both gave out a really strong vibe of video gaming text to me. My site is the game is Astroids and it is Atari
so i wanted a feel like you were kind of in the game.
## System font is already installed on your local device and system. These are provided for you already on most programs. Web font is custom fonts that are on a server. These need certain elements to be able to use them. Web-safe is the computer already carrying the fonts, like word.  The importance of having fallback is the system will try and load the font for you to use if it does not end up not using it.
D.) First of all i start with reading what i neede to do. I then download any matirials that i may need. I then choose what story i wanted to use, once i picked it i got fonts that would fit the crytiria and thought of colors i could use that would fit. It was hard to figure out the fonts but i went back to read and i figuerd it out. I read alot of pepoles issues and learned from that.
