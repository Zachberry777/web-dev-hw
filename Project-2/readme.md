<h1>Strongman Traning</h1>
<h3>1. Putting in videos and pictures where old but fun to put back into the project.
it was nice to refresh the mind. The new thing i learned that was fun was the Navigation process. It was nice to learn and it really comes in handy.</h3>
<h3>2. I am exited to learn a new way to use atom and how to create with it. Its nice to know there is more than just one way to so things.</h3>
<h3>3. As always i will start with reading of what is needed for this project. I collected all the images and videos that i needed for the project and then made all the folders that they needed to go into. I then watched or read anything i needed to for the project. I started with atom and made my content. At the end of it i organized it to look cleaner.</h3>
