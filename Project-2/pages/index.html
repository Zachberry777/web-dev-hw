 Being strong is nice but being a Strongman is even better. Im not saying only men can do this but women too.
 There is big events every year where the biggest dudes get together and go through a strongman competition.
 This is too hold the title of the worlds strongest man. They train all year and train big, The biggest thing
 they  train is there appitite. A usuall calorie intake  is about 9 to 10 thousand callories per day when they
 are training big. That is alot of food to eat for an average person. The trick is to eat more everyday, im not saying to
 eat 10 thousand colaries, but to get more than 2,999 colaries to build a bigger mass to gain the muscle to become stronger.
  There plate is usually about 50% protien, 30% carbs, 20% greens and fats. Getting the right things to eat will help more than anything.
 If you dont eat big you will never get mass on those muscles. Eating is very important but so is the lifting
 iron part. Training the muscle to get bigger means the higher weights you lift. Body builders use lower weights
 and go for more reps for muscle build and tone. Strong man Go gor high wieghts and low reps for alot bigger
 muscle build with not to much tone. the average bodybuilder can deadlift around 600 pounds, but a strongman can get as much
 as over 1,000 pounds. So eating the right things and lifting hard can make you a strong man.
as long as you put in the hard work, anybody can do it. If your a beginner, Start off light or getting a trainer.
I would recommend learning the right techniqes of lifting because it is very dangerous and can get hurt very bad
for a long time if you screw up. Drinking lots of water and taking protien powder is amazing for your body and muscles. Try Drinking
Ptrotien in water or milk, dipending on the flavor, about 30 minutes before you work and and take some while you workout. Before every workout,
stretching and cardio is a good way not to hurt yourself later on. Rest days are also important for your body to recover and
to biuld back that muscle fibers you tore while lifting weights. Being strong feels amazing, and working out realeses endorphans
which is a chemical in your body that makes you feel good and healthy. There is alot of perks of being strong and inshape
and is an amzing sport to be apart of. Protien is good for building muscle and building back the torn muscle fibers.
Carbs are great for a work out because it keeps you awake in the gym and help you digest things slower. Greens are good for the
body with nutrition and keeping you healthy, and little fats can help you with energy in the gym and keep you going.
