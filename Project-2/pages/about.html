<h1> About me </h2>
  <br>
  <h3> I love to weight lift, as a teenager in high school i was picked on and i was a pretty weak and couldn't do
    any thing about it. After highschool i saw worlds strongest man competition and that was amazing to watch.
    Seeing all those giants on tv made me feel like i should get big. I started to watch alot of lifting videos
    and the diffrent kinds of exercizes. I would learn the terms and right techniqes of lifting. I then started
    to train and i feel in love with lifting weights. I started to get stronger and started to eat more. i also looked
    up the right suppliments to take for my body, i got protien powder and energy pills. Id never use steroids, im all
    natural. I felt better about myself and ive never been so strong. After that i got my friends to lift and id show
    them the right way and help them out. It felt very good. I didnt start lifting so i could beat up people. I started
    because it feels so good to be strong and to know if i needed to pretect my self or my family, that i could.
    Here is a video to show you how great it is. </h3>
