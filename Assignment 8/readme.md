##Final Assignment
1. A boarder is what gives you an edge that you can make something out of and make look nice around your work (Perimeter). Padding cushans the letters and images between that and the boarder. Thats there so it doesnt bleed. Margin is outside the boarder and is absolute and relative to size unites.
2. This assignment was very hard. CSS is alot harder to use and i suck at coding in the first place. My page is not even close to what it should look like but i did do alot of work and it has something there atleast.
3. First of all i start with reading what i neede to do. I then download any matirials that i may need. It took alot of time to get everything in when i had to think of what i wanted to put in first.
