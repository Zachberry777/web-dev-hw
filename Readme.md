### I am taking this class because i want to major in Meadia Arts and have to take all the courses for the BA. I want to become a basic Media Arts teacher for a high school with it.
The internet is a global computer network that people can use to find varirties of information and to comunicate. I learned that the government does not control the internet, but we as people do and do not. It is also crazy to think that people invent everything but we dont know the main place where it was created.
