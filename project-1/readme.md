*project 1
I used my phone to look up the lyrics from my favorite band and I choose this song becasue it's deep and when ever I'm gone i miss my wife. I used Google chrome for everything and got info from the class web site.

 I went to a Trojan Room Coffee Machine from 2000 in Febuary. It kind of looks like our first project we made. It looks like it was created like we just did it. Feel kind of news paper like and the way we did it makes it look a bit more clean then they did it back then.

 I first started with looking on the moodle page to get started. I read what i had to do so then went to the class site to read and watch through it. I had some issues like the picture so i had to go back a lesson to learn it again. I really enjoyed learning about the spacing and html.
